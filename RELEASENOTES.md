# irHub changelogs

## Version 0.9.10
This version is a small improvement in terms of performance and has some QoL updates and has a few bugfixes.

## Version 0.9.9

This version brings a basic auto update system which will later be expanded upon to be more detailed.

It is recommended to install this new version, so you always stay up to date with the latest features!

## Version 0.9.0

I am glad to announce we finally have a workable version ready for release!

In this version you'll be able to add your favorite iRacing tools and let them automatically start whenever you start playing iRacing!

Note that there are likely still some bugs; you can report them [here](https://github.com/Marijn17s/irHub/issues/new)

There is still a lot to be done, and I'm excited to see what we can make in the future.
